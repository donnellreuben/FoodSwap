# Recipe Swap
#### - I forged an app that I named "Recipe Swap". This app allows users to swap homemade meals with each other. Users can sign up, create a profile, and list the meals they're willing to swap. They can search for other users in their area who have meals they're interested in and initiate a swap. The app would also allow users to rate and review the meals they receive, helping to build a community of foodies who love to cook and share their creations.
